text.cliente.textoHome= Hoyos is a haven of light, of noble houses and streets where popular images survive, such as images of lace makers. The town is surrounded by beautiful and numerous family orchards of orange and lemon trees that deliciously perfume the environment when the orange blossom blooms, exotic trees such as ornamental and delicate Camellia, Serengeti acacias, Sequoias and guavas. The benign climate of this Serragat land, with a temperate continental Mediterranean-type microclimate, makes it a privileged corner. The average annual temperature oscillates around 14 degrees. Its landscape is characterized by the presence of oak groves, cork oak groves, chestnut groves, along with olive groves, vineyards, orchards and meadows. All of this makes Villa de Hoyos an authentic paradise, a small rural garden, upon whose discovery the traveler can contemplate the serenity, beauty and poetry that inhabit it.You are invited and we hope you like it and enjoy your visit to our small town!

#Historia
text.cliente.gustar=We hope you like it and enjoy it.
text.cliente.historiaTitulo=HISTORICAL COMPLEX
text.cliente.historia1=The history of Hoyos was related to ancient Roman and Arab settlements... but what is most recognized is the Reconquest stage, when the territory of Hoyos would be incorporated into the Kingdom of León. At the beginning of the 19th century, the town suffered the consequences of the War of Independence, as the Port of Perales was an obligatory passage for French troops. The elderly Bishop of Coria Don Juan Álvarez de Castro, who recommended the union of the people and submission to the Juntas through the publication of his pastorals, was persecuted by the invaders until he was assassinated on August 29, 1809 in his house in holes. From the year 1840, Villa de Hoyos was the head of the broad judicial district that came to include eighteen population entities. Due to the fact that Hoyos was chosen by a certain nobility and by the bishops of Coria as a place of summer residence, the historic center presents an important artistic interest. We recommend to the traveler a tour through its holy streets that give the presence of the towns that have lived intensely through history. In this route, at every moment, we enter the surprise of a beautiful corner: a shield that rings a high semicircular gate, a suggestive Gothic-Renaissance style inn, ornamental modulations, a palatial house, more inns, more shields, a fountain, a cruise….   
text.cliente.historia2=The historic center is located around the Church of the Good Man, which frames three large squares: Constitución, Mayor and Gabriel y Galán or "El Coso", the old bullring. The Plaza Mayor is a wide open space in front of the western façade of the temple, with its Romanesque portal. In this enclosure stands the Town Hall, of noble presence. The two most important streets leave the square, heading north, Obispo Álvarez de Castro street, where we find a mixture of typical popular houses together with some remarkable ashlar stone mansions adorned with stupendous mullioned windows decorated with floral decorations; and heading south, the Antigua Calle Real, which constitutes the southern entrance to the town that stretches to the Escobar neighborhood, the hermitage of Cristo Bendito, passing the ruins of the Franciscan Convent of the Holy Spirit whose founder, son of Hoyos, named Pablo Pérez , accompanied Pizarro in the conquest of America, along with many other "soyanos" such as Marcos Veas.
text.cliente.historia3=Le centre historique est situé autour de l'église du Bon Homme, qui encadre trois grandes places : Constitución, Mayor et Gabriel y Galán ou "El Coso", l'ancienne arène. La Plaza Mayor est un grand espace ouvert devant la façade ouest du temple, avec son portail roman. Dans cette enceinte se dresse la mairie, de noble prestance. Les deux rues les plus importantes partent de la place, vers le nord, la rue Obispo Álvarez de Castro, où l'on trouve un mélange de maisons populaires typiques ainsi que de remarquables demeures en pierre de taille ornées de magnifiques fenêtres à meneaux décorées de décorations florales ; et vers le sud, l'Antigua Calle Real, qui constitue l'entrée sud de la ville qui s'étend jusqu'au quartier Escobar, l'ermitage de Cristo Bendito, en passant devant les ruines du couvent franciscain du Saint-Esprit dont le fondateur, fils de Hoyos, nommé Pablo Pérez , a accompagné Pizarro dans la conquête de l'Amérique, ainsi que de nombreux autres "soyanos" tels que Marcos Veas.

text.cliente.historia5=To say that we have the House of Vernacular Architecture, an architectural jewel in itself, which takes us back to the way our ancestors lived in the 19th century. This house houses exhibitions as well as serving as a tourist information point. It is located at Calle Obispo Álvarez de Castro nº 57.
text.cliente.historia6=Hoyos is lucky to be a town steeped in art, but the most characteristic building and one of great artistic interest is the Church of Nuestra Señora del Buen Varón, whose seated image, dating back to the 13th century, presides over the main altarpiece, Compleja is the constructive history of the parish of this locality. Tradition has it that the temple was founded by a legendary character, some rural teacher related to the Trevejo charge in the first half of the 13th century.
text.cliente.historia7=The primitive temple would be expanded as the demography of the place grew at the end of the 15th century, when the new temple began, inserting it into the previous one. It shows the hand of Pedro de Ybarra who possibly directed the works between 1545 and 1560.
text.cliente.historia8=The parish church located in the center of the town, built with excellent ashlar stone, has three doorways open to each of its squares giving access to the temple. But at the main door, the most important from an artistic point of view, one of the few examples of late Romanesque style that can be found in Extremadura, belonging to the Old Medieval parish. The semicircular arch stands out in it, embellished with archivolts, with two columns on each side and attractive capitals with plant ornamentation, and images that perhaps allude to the Virgin Mary to whom the temple is dedicated. The other two portals are in the Gothic style and belong to the new construction of the first quarter of the 16th century. Of great interest are the gargoyles with tubular and animal shapes, as well as the eight curious pinnacles adorned with balls located in the upper area, which decorate and border the church.
text.cliente.historia9=The style of the interior of the church is very varied, but very similar to the neighboring parishes of Acebo and Gata, in which Pedro de Ybarra also intervened in great. The baroque main altarpiece, the work of the Churriguera circle, decorated with four Solomonic columns where the representation of the crucifixion of the Lord is found, along with Mary and Saint Peter from the 17th century. In the center of the most characteristic jewel of this chapel, the image of Our Lady of the Good Man from the 13th century to which this temple is dedicated, and below it is accompanied by the carving of the Immaculate Conception. On the sides, the images of San Ramón Nonato (XVIII) and San Bartolomé (XVI). We also discover the patron saints of the town of San Lorenzo on the left, and San Lino on the right, whose local festivals are on August 10 and September 23. The sacristy is endowed with images full of pain, dressed in black and with a sad look, she is in the most emblematic procession of Holy Week "La procesión de la Soledad". The Renaissance choir is of remarkable style, supported by three capitals, with an ancient organ, deteriorated by time and some altarpieces that were brought from the Convent of the Holy Spirit. To go up to the choir we must go up some spiral stairs that lead to the bell tower, opening like a fan with a total of 102 steps. From the bell tower you can see a beautiful panoramic view of the entire town and its natural environment. A notable element is the granite pulpit embedded in the arch of the 16th century main chapel.
