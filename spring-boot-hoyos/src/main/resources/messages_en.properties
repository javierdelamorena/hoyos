text.cliente.textoHome= Hoyos is a haven of light, of noble houses and streets where popular images survive, such as images of lace makers. The town is surrounded by beautiful and numerous family orchards of orange and lemon trees that deliciously perfume the environment when the orange blossom blooms, exotic trees such as ornamental and delicate Camellia, Serengeti acacias, Sequoias and guavas. The benign climate of this Serragat land, with a temperate continental Mediterranean-type microclimate, makes it a privileged corner. The average annual temperature oscillates around 14 degrees. Its landscape is characterized by the presence of oak groves, cork oak groves, chestnut groves, along with olive groves, vineyards, orchards and meadows. All of this makes Villa de Hoyos an authentic paradise, a small rural garden, upon whose discovery the traveler can contemplate the serenity, beauty and poetry that inhabit it.You are invited and we hope you like it and enjoy your visit to our small town!

#Historia
text.cliente.gustar=We hope you like and will enjoy it. 
text.cliente.historia0=History
text.cliente.historia1=The history of Hoyos is related to old roman and arabic settlements, yet it is best known for the time of the Reconquest, a time when the territory of Hoyos was annexed to the Kingdom of Leon. Later on, at the beginning of the XIX century, Hoyos suffered the consequences of the War of Independence, since Puerto Perales was an obligated pass for the French troops. The elderly bishop of Coria, Don Juan Álvarez de Castro  was persecuted and assassinated at his house in Hoyos by the invaders on the 29th of August 1809.
text.cliente.historia2=Since 1840 the Villa of Hoyos was head of an ample judicial area comprising eighteen villages. Hoyos had been chosen as a summer residence by certain nobles and by the bishops of Coria, and therefore developed an historic centre of high artistic importance.
text.cliente.historia3=A walk through its old streets will reveal beautiful images of the past. Through these narrow streets the traveller will encounter surprising spots, a delight around each corner, a coat of arms that crests a high rounded arch door, an evocative gothic-renaissance window, a palace, a fountain, an old stone cross…
text.cliente.historiaConjuntoHistorico=Old Town
text.cliente.historia4=The historic center is organized around the Iglesia del Buén Baron, which is surrounded by three main squares, the Plaza Constitución, Plaza Mayor and Plaza Gabriel y Galán or “El Coso”, the old bullfighting arena. The Plaza Mayor is an ample open space in front of the west façade of the temple, facing its Romanesque main entry. The noble town hall also stands there. The two main village streets stem from this plaza; going north, the street Obispo Álvarez de Castro, where we find a mixture of typical popular houses next to stone masonry noble buildings, decorated with magnificent geminated windows. Going south from the Main Plaza we find the old Calle Real, which constitutes the southern entrance to the village, stretching to the Barrio El Escobar, to the Cristo Bendito chapel, and to the ruins of the old Espíritu Santo Franciscan monastery. 
text.cliente.historia5=Its religious architecture is quite significant, the Ermita del Cristo Bendito del Valle is representative of the primitive chapels, a square granite stonework building from the mid XVI century, which houses a carved statue of the Crucified Christ. The Franciscan Convent of the Espiritu Santo is in ruins nowadays, it dates from the second half of the XVI century, although it may have been completed in 1641, as it appears on top of the coat of arms of Pablo Perez.
text.cliente.historia6=The most characteristic building and one of outmost artistic interest is the “Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Buen Varón”, tradition tells that the temple was founded by a legendary character during the first half of the XIII century.The primitive temple was extended gradually as population expanded, and towards the end of the XV century a new temple was built embedded into the old one.
text.cliente.historia7=The church was built with ashlar stone and has three doors accessing each of the plazas. The main door, part of the primitive medieval temple, is one of the few examples in Extremadura of the late Romanesque style. Its semi-circular arch stands out, embellished by two archivolts with two columns at each side and charming capitals with vegetable ornaments and images that may refer to the Virgin Mary, to whom the temple is dedicated. The other two facades are of Gothic style and belong to the new building from the XVI century. The gargoyles showing tubular and animal shapes are also of great interest, as well as the eight pinnacles decorated with balls which are placed at the top of the church.
text.cliente.historia8=The inside of the church has a quite varied style, and holds several interesting artistic pieces. The baroque altarpiece from the XVII century is decorated with four solomonic columns and represents the crucifixion of Christ, together with Maria and San Pedro. At the center lays the most representative jewel of the chapel, an image of Nuestra Señora del Buen Varón, from the XIII century. We can also find images of the patrons of the village, San Lorenzo, and San Lino. There is also a Renaissance choir of a remarkable style, with an Antigua organ, quite deteriorated, and some altar pieces brought from the Convent of the Espiritu Santo. By climbing up a spiral staircase of 102 steps one can access the choir. From the bell tower there is a magnificent view of the village and its surroundings. A more recent architectural jewel stands at the top part of the village, a neatly maintained representative of Vernacular Architecture. A house you can visit and get transported to the past, to the manner in which our ancestors lived in the XIX century. It is currently used as a tourist information point and as an exhibition space.
